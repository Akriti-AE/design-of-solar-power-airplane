# Application of Tilt Wing UAV Methodologies in the Design of Solar Powered Airplane
In this project, I applied design methodologies from Tilt Wing UAVs to create an integrated energy and mass model for a Solar Powered Airplane. Drawing inspiration from the unique features of Tilt Wing UAVs, I developed a model that optimized both energy efficiency and mass distribution for solar-powered flight. The model was meticulously validated using MATLAB, where I demonstrated successful mass convergence, confirming the practical viability of the design approach. This validation showcased the effectiveness of incorporating Tilt Wing UAV techniques into the design of a solar-powered aircraft, highlighting its potential for sustainable and efficient flight solutions.
